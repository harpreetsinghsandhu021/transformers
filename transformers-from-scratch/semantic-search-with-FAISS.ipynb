It turns out that one can pool the individual embeddings to create a vector representation of whole sentences, paras or even documents. These embeddings can then be used to find similar documents in the corpus by computing the dot-product similarity (or some other similarity metric) between each embedding and returning the documents with the greatest overlap."
